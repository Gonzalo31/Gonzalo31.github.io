<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Transition Year has enabled me to experience new areas that I wouldnâ€™t have been able to explore if it was a year like any other. I have also been able to socialize, making new friends, thanks to the first two trips that were being carried out in the first month of the year.<br>
I like every element of Transition Year. I enjoy the way it gives the students the responsibility of developing as a person. I love how the students get to do new things such as cooking. And what I certainly adore is the way the students can choose their optional subjects from a very varied collection. Thank you, Transition Year.
