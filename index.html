<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Transition Year has enabled me to experience new areas that I wouldn’t have been able to explore if it was a year like any other. I have also been able to socialize, making new friends, thanks to the first two trips that were being carried out in the first month of the year.<br>
I like every element of Transition Year. I enjoy the way it gives the students the responsibility of developing as a person. I love how the students get to do new things such as cooking. And what I certainly adore is the way the students can choose their optional subjects from a very varied collection. Thank you, Transition Year.

    <p class="picTitle" id="trips">The Aran Islands</p>
    <p class="picText">It was shocking for me to go on a trip on the first two weeks of the school year; but now I understand the importance of doing it so soon. It is like a welcoming to the students to feel more relaxed and meet new people. And it did work. I had an amazing time in the Aran Islands, cycling under heavy rain but also dancing with Irish music.
	The islands were deserted. Almost nobody lived there. You could clearly notice that the islands survived due to little tourism. I thought about how isolation might affect the lives of the small number of inhabitants, and one reason that led me to think about it is that an insignificant Spar seemed to be the main centre of commerce.

<h2><span class="titleLetter" >C</span>amping in Glendalough</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">After a couple of weeks or so, I and a small group went camping for Outward Bound to Glendalough. We came there by bus and then we walked for around four or five hours, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. It was certainly a pleasant walk, as we did not get across bad weather.<br>
When we arrived, which was very fortunate for me, as I was lacking energy, we set up the tents. The tents that we were given were made for three people, but a friend and I had to get one for us two only. I had for the first time in my life a genuine rough night, which really taught me how lucky I am to have a bed.

<h2><span class="titleLetter" id="activities" >E</span>xtra-curricular involvement</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Just as any year, I went to badminton every Monday. This year, I and another friend managed to attract much more people from our year to come and play this entertaining sport. I joined the badminton team and competed against other schools while having an enjoyable experience. As far as I know, we didn’t get to a semi-final or final. But it didn’t really matter.
</p>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">I am trilingual. I speak English, Spanish, and French. The problem is that I haven’t spoken French in a long time. I am forgetting the language and it slowly gets harder for me to orally express myself in a fluent manner. I already have French lessons, but I thought it wasn’t enough. That is why I joined the French Debate Club. I thought the club was only going to practise French internally, but then I was informed that we were going to compete against other schools. I quickly got very nervous as I was extremely not talented at public speaking. I participated at the only two debates that our school took part (we didn’t manage to get further). Our team of four people had to go twice to the <i>Alliance Française</i> at 7pm. The first debate went well, but unfortunately the second didn’t.</p>
