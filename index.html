<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >I</span>ntroduction</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Transition Year has enabled me to experience new areas that I wouldn’t have been able to explore if it was a year like any other. I have also been able to socialize, making new friends, thanks to the first two trips that were being carried out in the first month of the year.<br>
I like every element of Transition Year. I enjoy the way it gives the students the responsibility of developing as a person. I love how the students get to do new things such as cooking. And what I certainly adore is the way the students can choose their optional subjects from a very varied collection. Thank you, Transition Year.

    <p class="picTitle" id="trips">The Aran Islands</p>
    <p class="picText">It was shocking for me to go on a trip on the first two weeks of the school year; but now I understand the importance of doing it so soon. It is like a welcoming to the students to feel more relaxed and meet new people. And it did work. I had an amazing time in the Aran Islands, cycling under heavy rain but also dancing with Irish music.
	The islands were deserted. Almost nobody lived there. You could clearly notice that the islands survived due to little tourism. I thought about how isolation might affect the lives of the small number of inhabitants, and one reason that led me to think about it is that an insignificant Spar seemed to be the main centre of commerce.

<h2><span class="titleLetter" >C</span>amping in Glendalough</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">After a couple of weeks or so, I and a small group went camping for Outward Bound to Glendalough. We came there by bus and then we walked for around four or five hours, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. It was certainly a pleasant walk, as we did not get across bad weather.<br>
When we arrived, which was very fortunate for me, as I was lacking energy, we set up the tents. The tents that we were given were made for three people, but a friend and I had to get one for us two only. I had for the first time in my life a genuine rough night, which really taught me how lucky I am to have a bed.

<h2><span class="titleLetter" id="activities" >B</span>adminton</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Just as any year, I went to badminton every Monday. This year, I and a friend managed to attract much more people from our year to come and play this entertaining sport. I joined the badminton team and competed against other schools while having an enjoyable experience. That is why Badminton is my favourite sport. As far as I know, we didn’t get to a semi-final or final. But it didn’t really matter.

    <p class="picTitle">French Debate Club</p>
    <p class="picText">I am trilingual. I speak English, Spanish, and French. The problem is that I haven’t spoken French in a long time. I am forgetting the language and it slowly gets harder for me to orally express myself in a fluent manner. I already have French lessons, but I thought it wasn’t enough. That is why I joined the French Debate Club. I thought the club was only going to practise French internally, but then I was informed that we were going to compete against other schools. I quickly got very nervous as I was extremely not talented at public speaking. I participated at the only two debates that our school took part (we didn’t manage to get further). Our team of four people had to go twice to the <i>Alliance Française</i> at 7pm. The first debate went well, but unfortunately the second didn’t.

<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >D</span>own Syndrome Ireland</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">I went to Marks & Spencer on a Friday afternoon hoping to help collecting money from customers by bagging. The problem was that there were too much volunteers. A couple of tills had to be filled with two baggers. I wasn’t one of them. During those two hours, my job was to stand in front of the fast lane, due to its narrowness. I couldn’t bag for the customers. The only thing that I could do was smiling and say “thank you, have a nice day” each time someone placed money in the bucket I was holding. I had a lot of time to think about the best way to do the task assigned, and I came with the conclusion that smiling takes an important role. Even though it was a monotonous job, I think it was really worth participating in order to help the people suffering from the Down syndrome. I enjoyed listening to other students’ stories about the people that they talked to. I would happily participate again in these volunteer activities.

<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >W</span>inter Fair</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">The Winter Fair took place the 15th of December 2016 in the Senior Hall. I found the Winter Fair particularly exiting. I was assigned to the waffle stand. I was given the small task of creating a poster. After serious thinking, I decided to make it simple but effective. There would be a lot of stalls in the fair, so I thought people might not spend much time reading advertisements. So I came up with this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">The first thing I did when we had to prepare the stand was to hang the posters (I made two). But I wasn’t satisfied. Not much people could see it. I decided to walk around the Senior Hall making advertisement. There were too many people to help at my stand so that was the main reason that I did that. It turned out great because many people asked me about the price of the waffles, besides, I enjoyed stretching the legs and talking to people along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="work_experience"><span class="titleLetter" >W</span>ork Experience</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">In my first week of Work Experience, I went to a firm called Evercam. I saw them in the internet and emailed them, just like the other Work Experience places I got. Evercam placed cameras on construction sites for other companies and then made a software to show those pictures to the client company. The images taken by the cameras speed up the construction process. Architects and engineers can consult the pictures for multiple purposes, for example, checking the time in which a structure was built.<br>
It will probably be the best Work Experience I will ever have. The ambience was really nice and I did learn a quite important lesson; publish websites, just like this one. The CEO of the company (Marco Herbst) gave me the task of publishing a website for him, in which he could easily write new blogs and have additional information about him. You can see the website by clicking <a class="external_links"  href="http://marcoherbst.com/">here</a>. I already knew how to code a website, but now I think that being able to publish websites will significantly impact my life.<br>
In my second week of Work Experience, I went to a charity shop called Action Aid. I met two Italians that were in Ireland for a week to learn English. I liked spending my time at the library section of the shop, rearranging new-coming books. But most of the time I and the two Italians had to move furniture for different purposes, such as redecoration of the shop or home delivery service. What I found particularly surprising was the fact that the part-time male volunteers were moving furniture while the part-time female volunteers were ironing the newly-received clothes. Apart from this shocking statement, I have to admit that I had a good time. I talked to my co-workers, the tasks that I was given weren’t exhausting, and I could even take a free book from the shop's library.
