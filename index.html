<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >I</span>ntroduction</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Transition Year has enabled me to experience new areas that I wouldn’t have been able to explore if it was a year like any other. I have also been able to socialize, making new friends, thanks to the first two trips that were being carried out in the first month of the year.<br>
I like every element of Transition Year. I enjoy the way it gives the students the responsibility of developing as a person. I love how the students get to do new things such as cooking. And what I certainly adore is the way the students can choose their optional subjects from a very varied collection. Thank you, Transition Year.

    <p class="picTitle" id="trips">The Aran Islands</p>
    <p class="picText">It was shocking for me to go on a trip on the first two weeks of the school year; but now I understand the importance of doing it so soon. It is like a welcoming to the students to feel more relaxed and meet new people. And it did work. I had an amazing time in the Aran Islands, cycling under heavy rain but also dancing with Irish music.
	The islands were deserted. Almost nobody lived there. You could clearly notice that the islands survived due to little tourism. I thought about how isolation might affect the lives of the small number of inhabitants, and one reason that led me to think about it is that an insignificant Spar seemed to be the main centre of commerce.

<h2><span class="titleLetter" >C</span>amping in Glendalough</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">After a couple of weeks or so, I and a small group went camping for Outward Bound to Glendalough. We came there by bus and then we walked for around four or five hours, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. It was certainly a pleasant walk, as we did not get across bad weather.<br>
When we arrived, which was very fortunate for me, as I was lacking energy, we set up the tents. The tents that we were given were made for three people, but a friend and I had to get one for us two only. I had for the first time in my life a genuine rough night, which really taught me how lucky I am to have a bed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span class="titleLetter" id="activities" >B</span>adminton</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Just as any year, I went to badminton every Monday. This year, I and a friend managed to attract much more people from our year to come and play this entertaining sport. I joined the badminton team and competed against other schools while having an enjoyable experience. That is why Badminton is my favourite sport. As far as I know, we didn’t get to a semi-final or final. But it didn’t really matter.

    <p class="picTitle">French Debate Club</p>
    <p class="picText">I am trilingual. I speak English, Spanish, and French. The problem is that I haven’t spoken French in a long time. I am forgetting the language and it slowly gets harder for me to orally express myself in a fluent manner. I already have French lessons, but I thought it wasn’t enough. That is why I joined the French Debate Club. I thought the club was only going to practise French internally, but then I was informed that we were going to compete against other schools. I quickly got very nervous as I was extremely not talented at public speaking. I participated at the only two debates that our school took part (we didn’t manage to get further). Our team of four people had to go twice to the <i>Alliance Française</i> at 7pm. The first debate went well, but unfortunately the second didn’t.

<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >D</span>own Syndrome Ireland</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">I went to Marks & Spencer on a Friday afternoon hoping to help collecting money from customers by bagging. The problem was that there were too much volunteers. A couple of tills had to be filled with two baggers. I wasn’t one of them. During those two hours, my job was to stand in front of the fast lane, due to its narrowness. I couldn’t bag for the customers. The only thing that I could do was smiling and say “thank you, have a nice day” each time someone placed money in the bucket I was holding. I had a lot of time to think about the best way to do the task assigned, and I came with the conclusion that smiling takes an important role. Even though it was a monotonous job, I think it was really worth participating in order to help the people suffering from the Down syndrome. I enjoyed listening to other students’ stories about the people that they talked to. I would happily participate again in these volunteer activities.

<h2 id="intro"><span class="titleLetter" >W</span>inter Fair</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">The Winter Fair took place the 15th of December 2016 in the Senior Hall. I found the Winter Fair particularly exiting. I was assigned to the waffle stand. I was given the small task of creating a poster. After serious thinking, I decided to make it simple but effective. There would be a lot of stalls in the fair, so I thought people might not spend much time reading advertisements. So I came up with this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!-------WAFFLE-PICTURE------->
<section class="wafflePicSection">
  <div class="wafflePicture">
  </div>
</section>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">The first thing I did when we had to prepare the stand was to hang the posters (I made two). But I wasn’t satisfied. Not much people could see it. I decided to walk around the Senior Hall making advertisement. There were too many people to help at my stand so that was the main reason that I did that. It turned out great because many people asked me about the price of the waffles, besides, I enjoyed stretching the legs and talking to people along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="work_experience"><span class="titleLetter" >W</span>ork Experience</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">In my first week of Work Experience, I went to a firm called Evercam. I saw them in the internet and emailed them, just like the other Work Experience places I got. Evercam placed cameras on construction sites for other companies and then made a software to show those pictures to the client company. The images taken by the cameras speed up the construction process. Architects and engineers can consult the pictures for multiple purposes, for example, checking the time in which a structure was built.<br>
It will probably be the best Work Experience I will ever have. The ambience was really nice and I did learn a quite important lesson; publish websites, just like this one. The CEO of the company (Marco Herbst) gave me the task of publishing a website for him, in which he could easily write new blogs and have additional information about him. You can see the website by clicking <a class="external_links"  href="http://marcoherbst.com/">here</a>. I already knew how to code a website, but I now think that being able to publish websites will significantly impact my life.<br>
In my second week of Work Experience, I went to a charity shop called Action Aid. I met two Italians that were in Ireland for a week to learn English. I liked spending my time at the library section of the shop, rearranging new-coming books. But most of the time I and the two Italians had to move furniture for different purposes, such as redecoration of the shop or home delivery service. What I found particularly surprising was the fact that the part-time male volunteers were moving furniture while the part-time female volunteers were ironing the newly-received clothes. Apart from this shocking statement, I have to admit that I had a good time. I talked to my co-workers, the tasks that I was given weren’t exhausting, and I could even take a free book from the shop's library.

<h2 id="pe"><span class="titleLetter" >O</span>utward Bound and PE</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">I was in the Outward Bound group at the first half of the year. I really enjoyed going camping to Glendalough, as I already mentioned. However, for the first time in my life, I have experienced the astonishing sport of outdoor rock climbing. Our group had to get the DART at lunch to go to Dalkey, where a cliff was waiting for us. We first had to descend it and then climb it. Descending was the worst part. You can’t see what’s underneath you when you start. Due to this fear, it took much more time to go down than to go up.<br>
Another activity that pleased me was kayaking. I went kayaking on the third week of Outward Bound in Dun Laoghaire. It turned out fantastic. The water was freezing, but I didn’t get wet as I got lucky to not been thrown out of my canoe by somebody else. It was a shame that it didn’t last longer.

<div class="textSection">
<h2 id="programming"><span class="titleLetter" >P</span>rogramming</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">This year I have learnt a lot about programming. I believe that it has been the most important part of the year. I didn’t even know what programming was before Transition Year. The Coding/Web Design and Information Studies lessons have introduced me into the programming world. Unfortunately, there are very few periods offered, nonetheless, I was so fascinated by what computers could do for you that I decided to learn programming on my own, beyond the limits that the school classes offer. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. These are simply different languages in which you can code. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are languages used to design websites, while Python is a multi-purpose language.<br>
I learnt programming from websites such as <a class="external_links"  href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> and <a class="external_links"  href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Code Academy</a>. Then I learnt a few bits and pieces for coding websites with <a class="external_links"  href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>.<br>
	It’s a shame I deleted the first website that I have ever done, however I can show you this one, made in October or November 2016. Click <a class="external_links"  href="/dreamtravel.htm">here</a> to see it. Even though it is poorly designed, I think it was a big step to learning essential parts of a good website. In this example, I made for the first time a header and a footer.<br>
I learned how to make websites look good, but I also learned how to make them more interactive. Take a look at this multiplying calculator:</p>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">&nbsp;</p>
<input type="text" id="myTextarea1">
x
<input type="text" id="myTextarea2">
=
<input type="text" id="myTextarea3">
<p>
  <input type="button" name="button" id="button" value="Calculate" onClick="multiply()">
</p>
	<p class="onlyTextSection-p">I was taught this in Coding/Web Design class. For the first time I could see the similarity between mathematics and coding. In this mini-program, I made the number in the third box equal to the first number multiplied by the second number. I only basically made the first number equal to <i>a</i>, the second equal to <i>b</i>, and the third equal to <i>c</i> so that then I could say that <i>c = a x b</i>. This little mathematical operation showed me how a computer can interact with pieces of information that a user gives (also called an <i>input</i>). This calculator used JavaScript, a language used for making websites more interactive. To see a far more complex example of what JavaScript can do, I am proud to present you with <a class="external_links"  href="/the_questionnaire.html">The Questionn"air"</a>, one of my earliest creations.<br>
Then I learnt about Python, the multi-purpose language. With Python, I learned the more technical and arithmetical part of programming, instead of designing with HTML and CSS. With Python, you can only type characters. No colours, no decoration, no text alignment, nothing as such. Only letters and numbers. Even though it has this limitation, it is insane the number of things you can do with programming.<br>
See an example of Python with my favourite own program, the <a class="external_links"  href="https://repl.it/Gwdp/3">Random Word Creator</a>. The words that it creates are realistic as it creates a more or less equal number of vowels and consonants. You can also check out <a class="external_links"  href="https://repl.it/Gqk4/8">Computer Guesses Your Number</a>, in which it is not you that has to guess the computer's number, but the computer itself has to guess your number. The computer isn’t really smart though so it might use up to fifty tries to get your number right. To see these programs running, please click the button “run” at the top right corner of the white compartment.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="titleLetter" >C</span>onclusion</h2>
<p class="onlyTextSection-p">Transition Year has been one of the best years in my life.<br>
What I liked the most about it is that it has made me more curious about other things that I would have never learnt about if it wasn’t because of this year. For example, wouldn’t sociology be interesting? Learn about how societies (and humanity) was created? It is these kinds of questions that make me think about the limitless interesting topics there are out there, that I haven’t yet discovered.<br>
I have also enjoyed a lot the trips of the first part of the year. I have never been in the west part of Ireland, so I was astonished when I arrived to the Aran Islands. Its landscape, its harsh weather, and more importantly, its isolation, were quite surprising to me. The trip to Glendalough was different. The landscape and the weather was different. They were both more friendly. And due to the number of tourists there, the place was not really isolated. The Aran Islands and Glendalough were practically opposites.<br>
Work Experience has affected me greatly. Working at Evercam has been a pleasant experience. It gave me an idea of what a start-up atmosphere looks like. I hope I will learn as much as I did there in the second period of Work Experience, where I will work for a week with architects and the other week with employees in the Argentinian Embassy. In addition to this, Action Aid has taught me how working in a charity shop can be tiring.<br>
Apart from that, Transition Year has made me think about the opportunities and options for my future. Even though I choose not to base my future on the EirQuest and the Cambridge Exam results, I have to say that they did help me get a general overview of my interests. I now choose to work in the IT (Information Technology) sector, although the EirQuest advised me to work in civil engineering. But this is fine, because other parts of the TY course, such as Web Design/ Coding and Information Studies, showed me my interest in computer science.<br>
Transition Year has been fantastic as a whole. I made new valuable friends and at the same time I became more curious about the world that surrounds us, which in my opinion it is one of the most important mindsets to have.
